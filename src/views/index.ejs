  <h2>About the Owners</h2>
  <p>
    Fancy Dress Boutique was founded by Emma Johnson and Olivia White, two
    fashion enthusiasts with a passion for helping others find the perfect dress
    for every occasion. After working in the fashion industry for over 10 years,
    they decided to open a shop that blends style, comfort, and elegance. Their
    goal is to provide high-quality dresses that make every customer feel
    beautiful and confident.
